	  the DOM based data model. This is now the default data model.
	* Implemented XercesConfiguration, to enable use of the Xerces-C DOM
	  based data model.
	* Implemented EventHandler, an event based execution interface. This is
	  used primarily for efficient evaluation of constructed nodes. This can

	  XQuery external functions.

	  warning and trace messages.

	  "let" expressions.

	  when parsing.

	* Fixed parse errors in the DOM3 API, which were being thrown as
	  XQException instead of XQillaException. [1626534]
	* Fixed the building of shared libraries under Cygwin, by adding
	  -no-undefined to the libtool line in the Makefile. [1639669]
	* Fixed a bug in the static typing of user defined functions, that could
